goliath is big.  

it has the stated aim of detecting candidate events in files by performing the line integral
transform of the cross wigner-ville distribution formed from the two channel data taken by the
project8 receiver.

it also aims to be as efficient and fast as possible.  the XWVD is not a quick process, but is
provably optimal in terms of SNR - hence its use.  the current implementation is a factor of 5 or
so faster than MATLAB, with hopes of getting faster still.

depends on OpenCV and Monarch.

A work in progress!!!
